# Uploads Directory

This directory stores uploaded media files (images, logos, favicons, etc.)

Files are organized in subfolders:
- `/uploads/logo` - Site logo and branding
- `/uploads/favicon` - Favicon images
- `/uploads/blog` - Blog post images
- `/uploads/pages` - Page builder images
- `/uploads/` - General uploads

Each uploaded file automatically generates multiple size variants:
- `thumb-*` - 300px wide thumbnails
- `medium-*` - 800px wide images
- `large-*` - 1200px wide images
